# **Aviation Safety Analysis**

## Project Overview:
This analysis identifies the safest aircraft manufacturers for Teroh Airways' new fleet acquisition strategy. Using historical accident data, we provide data-driven recommendations for aircraft purchasing decisions.

## Key Insights:

### 1. Safest Aircraft Manufacturers:
Identified the top 5 safest aircraft makes based on fatality percentage:
- **GRUMMAN ACFT ENG COR-SCHMEIZER** (1.7% fatality rate)
- **BOMBARDIER INC** (2.9% fatality rate)
- **STIMSON** (3.3% fatality rate)
- **BOEING** (3.5% fatality rate)
- **Raven** (3.5% fatality rate)

### 2. Safety Trends Over Time:
Analyzed aviation safety improvements from 2010-2022:
- Industry fatality rate decreased from 23.0% (2015) to 18.7% (2022)
- Top manufacturers maintain consistent safety records over time

### 3. Top Manufacturers Maintain Safety in Adverse Weather:
- GRUMMAN, Boeing, and Raven show **0% fatality rates** in IMC (Instrument Meteorological Conditions)
- Top manufacturers perform **74–98% safer** than industry average in poor weather
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize manufacturers with proven all‑weather safety for operational resilience

## Recommendations:

#### **1. To the Chief Financial Officer: Prioritize Low Risk Aircraft in Initial Fleet Acquisition.**
By prioritizing aircraft from the top five safest manufacturers, Teroh Airways can achieve significant cost advantages. These proven-safe aircraft typically command 15-25% lower insurance premiums due to their superior safety records, directly improving the company's bottom line. Furthermore, their 74-91% lower fatality rates substantially reduce potential liability costs from lawsuits, while their established reliability leads to more predictable maintenance expenses and fewer operational disruptions. Banks also view these assets as better collateral, which can secure more favorable financing terms for fleet acquisition.

#### **2. To the Chief Executive Officer: Establish Safety-First Brand Positioning from Launch.**
A safety-first approach provides a powerful reputation and risk management strategy. The CEO can confidently present to investors and clients that Teroh Airways is launching with a fleet 74-91% safer than the industry average, a data-driven claim few competitors can match. Simultaneously, the Risk Assessment Department can quantify how this superior safety profile directly enhances the brand's value and mitigates long-term operational and reputational risks, creating a more resilient and valuable company from inception.

The CEO should integrate this compelling safety data into all investor pitches and client communications as a core differentiator. In parallel, Risk Assessment must build specific safety metrics into the formal brand's valuation and risk models. Together, both teams should develop and publish an annual "Safety Transparency Report," turning the company's analytical advantage into a tool for regulatory goodwill and positive public relations, solidifying their market position as the industry's most trustworthy new entrant.

#### **3. To the Insurance UnderWriters: Implement Data Driven Premium Structures.**
This analysis provides a precise, data-driven framework for assessing and pricing risk. These insights can be applied by offering Teroh Airways a preferential premium rate—such as a 20% discount—for their commitment to exclusively selecting aircraft from the top five safest manufacturers identified in the analysis. Furthermore, this analysis serves as the ideal baseline to create a graduated, tiered premium scale where rates directly correlate to an airline's fleet composition across established safety tiers. Adopting this model transforms subjective risk assessment into an objective, equitable standard that can be applied across your aviation portfolio.
